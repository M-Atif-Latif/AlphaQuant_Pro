## Technologies Used

*   **Python**
*   **Streamlit:** For the web application interface.
*   **yfinance:** To fetch stock market data.
*   **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
*   **Plotly (plotly.graph_objects, plotly.express, plotly.subplots):** For creating interactive charts.
*   **Statsmodels:** For SARIMA forecasting, seasonal decomposition, and AD Fuller test.
*   **Scikit-learn:** For Random Forest Regressor and metrics (MSE, MAE, R2).
*   **Keras (TensorFlow backend):** For LSTM neural network model (Sequential, LSTM, Dense, Dropout).
*   **Prophet (by Facebook):** For time series forecasting.
*   **TA-Lib (Technical Analysis Library, via `ta`):** For calculating technical indicators (RSI, Bollinger Bands, MACD).

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd AlphaQuant_Pro
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file with all the necessary packages.
    ```
    streamlit
    yfinance
    pandas
    numpy
    plotly
    requests
    statsmodels
    scikit-learn
    tensorflow # or keras if using standalone Keras
    prophet
    ta
    ```
    Then run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: Installing `prophet` can sometimes be tricky. Refer to the official [Prophet installation guide](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/installation.html) if you encounter issues.*
    *For `tensorflow` (Keras backend), ensure you have compatible versions and potentially CUDA/cuDNN for GPU support if desired.*

## Usage

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd path/to/AlphaQuant_Pro
    ```

2.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

3.  Open your web browser and go to the local URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

4.  **Using the Application:**
    *   **Sidebar Navigation:**
        *   Choose between "Market Analysis" and "Forecasting" modes.
        *   Select a sector and then a specific ticker.
        *   Set the desired date range and data interval.
        *   For "Market Analysis", you can select up to 4 tickers for comparison.
        *   For "Forecasting", select a forecasting model and adjust its parameters (forecast period, SARIMA orders, LSTM settings).
    *   **Market Analysis Page:**
        *   Click "ðŸ“Š Fetch Market Data" to load and display stock information.
        *   View key metrics (current price, 52-week range, daily return, average volume).
